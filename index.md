# Easy DNN #
This is the project page for the __Easy DNN__ toolkit based on [Chainer](http://www.chainer.org).

As it name, the project is written in the way that it is easy to use. For examle,

   ```
   python train_segmenter.py --nnet-struct="linear(248-1024):tanh:lstm(1024-1024):tanh:dropout:linear(1024-3)"
   ```

will train a neural network with the structure that is easy to understand without any further explanation! I believe so!

# Why should I use Easy DNN #
There are a lot of features inside __Easy DNN__, here are some stand out points:

* Defining a nueral net structure easily with many type of layers (Linear, LSTM, ...).
* Supporting both GPU and CPU computation.
